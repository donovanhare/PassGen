# Password Generator
A simple PHP password generator, that creates a password matching certain critera. 

[View LIVE example.](https://passgen.donovanhare.co.uk)

The linux word dictonary is used to pick a random word that meets the length requirements, a seed is then appended to the end of the word acting as a slight safeguard against dictonary attacks.

Use this generator at your own risk, the passwords that are generated aren't particularly strong in the grand scheme of things.

If you would like to [generate a STRONG password](https://www.dashlane.com/en/cs/nKh9p_9mZdH2) I suggest you use a password generating program such as [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/en/cs/nKh9p_9mZdH2).
